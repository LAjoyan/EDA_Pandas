    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Kickstarter is a service where anyone can try to get funding from private individuals and companies to realize a project. The data consists of a few thousand published projects. If you are unsure about what Kickstarter is, google it! :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to use the Python library \"pandas\" to work with the data. This lab assumes that you have studied and participated in lessons on pandas to master the solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Jupyter Notebook in VS Code (Option 1), Recommended\n",
    "Solve the notebook in VS Code. You will then need to install pandas using pip or conda, for example, \"pip install pandas\". Follow this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNk-ZmeIz6c&ab_channel=VeryAcademy\n",
    "**NOTE** IF YOU ARE GOING TO INCLUDE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT (VENV), YOU MUST NAME IT \"VENV\" OR CHANGE THE NAME IN THE .gitignore FILE TO THE SAME NAME AS YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. In other words, you should not push your virtual environment to git! In many cases, you do not need a virtual environment (venv); you can run pip install pandas directly. Try changing the \"interpreter\" by typing ctrl + shift + p --> select interpreter --> test all your different versions of python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot run your cells, make sure you have selected a \"kernel\" at the top right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Google Colab for your Notebook (Option 2), Not Recommended\n",
    "You can complete the task using Google Colab. You will need to upload main.ipynb followed by adding the test data \"kickstarter.csv\". Just keep in mind that at least 2-3 times during the process, you should save the file, make a commit in git, and push it out. Then you continue. This is the disadvantage of Colab—that we cannot work with git as smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to work in the Notebook\n",
    "- **It must be possible to run the code from start to finish and get the same result again.**\n",
    "- You should describe the code in each cell so that I can see that you understand what you are doing.\n",
    "- Use the documentation as support: [https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html)"
